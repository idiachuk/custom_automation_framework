# Ingenious Build's Automation Challenge
## Introduction
### What is this about
As part of our selection process we task candidates with some real-life like exercises to have a better understanding of their expertise.

### Why do we care
We recognize that all people are different, so it is really important for us to both give candidates the chance to demonstrate their abilities, and for us to have something concrete to talk about in the following technical interview. Candidates in their uniqueness could find diverse ways of addressing the same issues. Even in ways we may have not considered before when creating this assignment.

We want to evaluate applicants with an open mind. We want them to tell us who they are, what they would bring to the table, and discuss it together.
